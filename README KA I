# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction – Kaggle Assignment

## 📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts **housing prices** based on multiple features such as area type, location, size, number of bedrooms, availability, and other property-related attributes.

This assignment is implemented and evaluated using the **Kaggle platform**, following a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset is provided as part of the Kaggle assignment and consists of:

- `train.csv` – Contains input features along with the target variable (`price`)
- `test.csv` – Contains input features without the target variable (used for final prediction)

The data includes both **numerical** and **categorical** variables such as:
- Area type
- Availability
- Location
- Size (BHK)
- Total square feet
- Bath
- Balcony
- Price (target)

## 🔧 Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in the notebook:

- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Preprocessing, modeling, evaluation  
- **LightGBM** – Gradient boosting regression model  
- **SciPy** – Statistical analysis

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the structure and quality of the data:

- Viewing dataset shape and sample records
- Checking missing values
- Identifying unique values in categorical columns
- Understanding feature distributions
- Detecting skewness and outliers in numerical features

This step helps in making informed preprocessing and modeling decisions.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps are applied:

### 1. Handling Missing Values
- Numerical missing values are filled using appropriate statistical measures
- Categorical missing values are handled using mode or removed if insignificant

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Conversion of `total_sqft` into numeric format
- Extraction of numerical information from text-based columns
- Removal of irrelevant or redundant columns

### 3. Encoding Categorical Variables
- Categorical features such as `area_type` and `location` are encoded using:
  - Label Encoding
  - One-Hot Encoding (where required)

### 4. Feature Scaling
- Numerical features are scaled using standardization to improve model performance

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
Multiple regression models are trained and evaluated to compare performance:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **LightGBM Regressor**

Each model is trained on the processed training data and evaluated using validation metrics.

---

## 📏 Model Evaluation
Model performance is measured using:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**

A comparison of results across models is used to identify the most effective approach.

## 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning
For advanced models such as **Random Forest** and **LightGBM**, hyperparameter tuning is performed using:

- **GridSearchCV**
- Cross-validation

This improves generalization performance and reduces overfitting.

## 🏆 Best Model Selection
Based on validation performance, **LightGBM Regressor** is selected as the final model due to its superior accuracy and efficiency.
